# 📰 Blog Web Application – In‑Memory CRUD

**Built with Node.js, Express and EJS**  
**Personal Project** | Aug 2025

---

## 📌 Project Overview

A simple blog where users can create, view, edit, and delete posts. This version intentionally uses in‑memory storage (no database), so posts reset when the server restarts. The UI is server‑rendered with EJS templates and a small CSS file for basic styling.

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ **CRUD** – Create, read, update, and delete blog posts  
- ✅ **Server‑side rendering** – EJS templates for pages and forms  
- ✅ **In‑memory storage** – No database; great for learning/testing  
- ✅ **Minimal stack** – Fast to set up and run

## 💬 Reflection

This project was a focused exercise in Express routing and EJS templating. Keeping storage in memory made it fast to iterate on CRUD flows and page rendering without database overhead.
