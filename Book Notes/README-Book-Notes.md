# 📚 Book Notes – Full-Stack CRUD App

**Built with Node.js, Express, EJS, and PostgreSQL**  
**Personal Project** | Aug 2025

## 📌 Project Overview

Book Notes is a personal project that lets me track books I’ve read with ratings, dates, and notes. It also pulls book covers from the Open Library Covers API (via ISBN).  
This project focuses on server-side rendering with EJS, integrating a public API, and implementing full CRUD backed by PostgreSQL.

## 💬 Reflection

This project strengthened my understanding of Express routing, EJS templating, and integrating a public API. I designed a simple relational schema in PostgreSQL and implemented full CRUD with clean, server-rendered pages and basic error handling.
